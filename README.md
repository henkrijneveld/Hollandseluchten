# Hollandseluchten
My python files to perform statistical analyses on air measurements in North-Holland, the Netherlands. This is part of project "Hollandse Luchten".

## Intended use
These are my personal development files, not made to be reused as-is. As this is my first venture into Pandas probably not everything is the way it should be done, and not completely correct in the Pythonic way. Sorry for that. Statistical analysis tends to become messy very fast. By scripting everything the results should be reproducable at least.

## Prerequisites
- Development environment with Python, Pandas and Seaborn installed including all dependencies
- Raw sensor data (internal from project) installed  in ~/data-raw
- Development environment: Pycharm 2023.* (latest) Professional
