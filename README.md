# Hollandseluchten
My python files to perform statistical analyses on air measurements in North-Holland, the Netherlands.

## Intended use
These are my personal development files, not made to be reused as-is. As this is my first venture into Pandas probably not everything is the way it should be done, and not completely correct in the Pythonic way. Sorry for that.

## Prerequisites
- Development environment with Python, Pandas and Seaborn installed including all dependencies
- Raw sensor data (internal for project) installed  in ~/data-raw
- As development environment I use Pycharm 2023.* (latest) Professional
